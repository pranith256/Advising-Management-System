# Advisor-Matching-System

In the academic journey of a university student, identifying a suitable advisor is crucial. A well-matched advisor can offer tailored guidance, which can significantly influence the student's research direction and outcomes. However, with a vast array of advisors, each having unique research interests, pinpointing an ideal match is challenging. Our project, the "Advisor Matching System", aims to streamline this process by automating the matching of students to potential advisors based on shared research interests.
